Welcome to my little corner of Github, I'm _@AnonymusElephant_

I am studying Civic Engineering and Teaching (Computer Science track) at KTH  . I've learned everything from abstract data structures, low level hardware programming and syntax checking, to parallel programming, LLMs and AI-modelling, frontend, to mention a few areas.

Currently, I am wrapping up my final courses befor heading into my Master's Thesis. Apart from my studies I'm also for the fourth year in a row working as a TA where I lead exercises and help examine labs that students partake in.

Beyond programming and computers, my interests (to name a few) are in no particular order:

🎲 Games (both digital and physical) <br/>
📸 Photography <br/>
📖 Reading <br/>
🎧 Music (both listening to and playing) <br/>
⛰️ the outdoors (I see mountain, i summit!) <br/>
🧗 Rock climbing <br/>
🍿 Movies and series <br/>
